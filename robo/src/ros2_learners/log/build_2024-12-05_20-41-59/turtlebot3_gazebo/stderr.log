  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax

[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /home/vatsan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.31/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:441 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
